# Data Processing in Python (Part 2)

**Approximate duration:** 4 hours

# Prerequisites:

-   Basic knowledge of Python is required.
-   Attendees must be comfortable using variables for simple data types,
    as well as collections. Attendees should also be comfortable with
    loops and control flow and be familiar with the basics of using
    functions in Python.
-   To be able to participate in the exercises, participants must
    either:
    -   Have a local installation of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
        Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed
        can also be used to run the Notebook.
    -   Have a Google Account (to run in-browser as a Colab notebook)

## Summary

In this 4-hour workshop, students will learn basic data processing
skills using Python. Attendees will learn how to import code from other
modules and packages to take advantage of the existing Python ecosystem.
After seeing how to access packages, we will explore popular data
analysis packages. We will see how to use NumPy to perform operations on
large data arrays and how to use Matplotlib to generate clear data
visualisations. We will also scratch the surface on using pandas to
store data in tables. Along the way, we will discuss how to approach
new, unfamiliar packages and learn how to use them.

## Learning Objectives

1. Import code from existing modules and packages.
2. Use NumPy to easily process multidimensional data.
3. Use Matplotlib to generate different types of plots to visualise
   data.
4. Use pandas to represent data stored in tables.
5. Approach a new package and explore its documentation and examples.
